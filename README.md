A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a web app that uses modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like experience to users. Apps should be able to work offline. Whether that be displaying a proper "offline" message or caching app data for display purpose.

### A pwa includes:
#### Manifest file
Describe the resources your app will need, i.e. app's displayed name, icons etc.

#### Service Worker
Service worker provides ability to cache app resources. Be it JavaScript files or JSON data from a HTTP request.
